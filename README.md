# IPv4-Validator

The IPv4 Validator CLI application provides a convenient way to validate IPv4 addresses from your command line. It helps you ensure that an IPv4 address is correctly formatted and falls within the valid range of IP addresses.

IPv4 addresses are commonly used in networking to identify devices on a network. They consist of four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1). Validating IPv4 addresses is important to prevent errors and ensure that the addresses are properly configured.
